___

This is experimental code, that I don't consider quite ready to merge
into my development project area, and I want to keep it somewhat isolated
from the other files. Plans are to have this take over, and be a complete
revamp for the current site.

What's left
---

css
---
* Refactor resume css to follow theme
* Migrate resume css to SASS

Python Scripts
---
* refine script, create HTML, and CSS formatting

I'll try to keep all of this readme updated, and push regular commits to the repository.
